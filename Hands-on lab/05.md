## Exercise 5: Migrate the Oracle database to SQL Server 2017

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will migrate the Oracle database into the "on-premises" SQL Server 2017 instance using SSMA.

### Task 1: Migrate the Oracle database to SQL Server 2017 using SSMA

1. On your LabVM, launch **Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle** from the Start Menu.

2. Select **File**, then **New Project...**

   ![File and New Project are highlighted in the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle.](./media/ssma-menu-file-new-project.png "Select New Project")

3. In the New Project dialog, accept the default name and location, select **SQL Server 2017** for the Migration To value, and select **OK**.

   ![In the New Project dialog box, SQL Server 2017 is selected and highlighted in the Migration To box.](./media/ssma-new-project.png "New Project dialog box")

4. Select **Connect to Oracle** in the SSMA toolbar.

   ![Connect to Oracle is highlighted on the SSMA toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-connect-to-oracle.png "Select Connect to Oracle")

5. In the Connect to Oracle dialog, enter the following:

   - **Provider**: Leave set to the default value, Oracle Client Provider for .NET.
   - **Mode**: Leave set to Standard mode.
   - **Server name**: Enter localhost.
   - **Server port**: Set to 1521.
   - **Oracle SID**: Enter XE.
   - **Username**: Enter NW.
   - **Password**: Enter oracledemo123

   ![The information above is entered in the Connect to Oracle dialog box, and Connect is selected at the bottom.](./media/ssma-connect-to-oracle.png "Specify the settings")

6. Select **Connect**.

7. In the Filter objects dialog, uncheck everything except the **NW**, **Sys**, and **System** databases.

   ![The NW database is highlighted and checked in the Filter objects dialog. The System database is checked, and all others are unchecked.](media/ssms-filter-objects.png "SSMA Filter objects")

8. In the Output window, you will see a message that the connection was established successfully, similar to the following:

   ![The successful connection message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-connect-to-oracle-success.png "View the successful connection message")

9. Under Oracle Metadata Explorer, expand the localhost node, Schemas, and confirm you can see the NW schema, which will be the source for the migration.

   ![The NW schema is highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-nw.png "Confirm the NW schema")

10. Next, select **Connect to SQL Server** from the toolbar, to add your SQL 2017 connection.

    ![Connect to SQL Server is highlighted on the toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-connect-to-sql-server.png "Select Connect to SQL Server")

11. In the connect to SQL Server dialog, provide the following:

    - **Server name**: Enter the IP address of your SqlServer2017 VM. You can get this from the Azure portal by navigating to your VM's blade, and looking at the Essentials area.

    ![The IP address of your SqlServer2017 VM is highlighted in the Essentials area of your VM's blade in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-sql-database-public-ip-address.png "Enter the IP address ")

    - **Server port**: Leave set to [default].
    - **Database**: Enter Northwind.
    - **Authentication**: Set to Windows Authentication.

    ![The information above is entered in the Connect to SQL Server dialog box, and Connect is selected at the bottom.](./media/ssma-connect-to-sql-server.png "Specify the settings")

12. Select **Connect**.

13. You will see a success message in the output window.

    ![The successful connection message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-connect-to-sql-server-success.png "View the successful connection message")

14. In the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, expand the server node, then Databases. You should see Northwind listed.

    ![Northwind is highlighted under Databases in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind.png "Verify the Northwind listing")

15. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, check the box next to NW, expand the NW database, and uncheck **Packages**. Next, select NW to make sure it is selected in the tree.

    ![The NW schema is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-nw-selected.png "Confirm the NW schema")

16. In the SQL Server Metadata explorer, check the box next to Northwind.

    ![Northwind is selected and highlighted under Databases in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-selected.png "Select Northwind")

17. In the SSMA toolbar, select **Convert Schema**. There is a bug in SSMA which prevents this button to being properly enabled, so if the button is disabled, you can select the NW node in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, which should cause the Convert Schema button to become enabled. You can also right-click on the NW database in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select Convert Schema if that does not work.

    ![Convert Schema is highlighted on the SSMA toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-convert-schema.png "Select Convert Schema")

18. After about a minute the conversion should have completed.

19. In the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, observe that new schema objects have been added. For example, under Northwind, Schemas, NW, Tables you should see the tables from the Oracle database.

    ![NW is selected in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, and tables from the Oracle database are visible below that.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-nw-tables.png "Observe new schema objects")

20. In the output pane, you will notice a message that the conversion finished with 1 error, and 21 warnings.

    ![The conversion message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-convert-schema-output.png "View the conversion message")

21. To view the errors, select the **Error List** at the bottom of the SSMA screen.

    ![Errors List is highlighted at the bottom of the SSMA screen.](./media/ssma-error-list.png "Select Errors List")

22. Select **Warnings** to hide the warnings, and leave only Errors displayed.

    ![The Warnings notification is highlighted in the Errors List.](./media/ssma-warnings.png "Warning tab")

23. Double-click on the error listed. This will display the Table in both Oracle and SQL Server that is causing the error, `EMPLOYEETERRITORIES`. Notice the Oracle table lists `EMPLOYEEID` with a data type of `NUMBER`, while SQL Server is expecting a data type of `float(53)`.

    ![NUMBER and float(53) are highlighted under Data Type, and EMPLOYEEID is selected in the split-screen views of the Table tab for Oracle and SQL Server.](./media/ssma-data-type-error.png "View the information")

24. Look at the table definition for the table on the Oracle side.

25. To change the data type, select the **Type Mapping** tab, select the row with source type of number, and select **Edit**.

    ![The Type Mapping tab is highlighted, and below that, the row with source type of number is highlighted, and Edit is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssma-source-type-mapping-number-edit.png "Change the data type")

26. In the Edit Type Mapping dialog, set the Target type to **numeric(precision, scale)**, set the Precision to **10**, and select **OK**.

    ![The information above is entered in the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, and OK is selected at the bottom.](./media/ssma-source-type-mapping-edit-type-mapping-number.png "Specify the settings")

27. Select **Apply** on the Type mapping tab.

    ![The row with source type of number is highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Apply is highlighted at the bottom.](./media/ssma-source-type-mapping-number-edit-apply.png "Select Apply")

28. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, right-click the `EMPLOYEETERRITORIES` table, and select **Convert Schema**.

    ![Convert Schema is highlighted in the submenu of the EMPLOYEETERRITORIES table in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-table-convert-schema.png "Select Convert Schema")

29. When prompted that the target exists, select **Overwrite**.

    ![Overwrite is selected and highlighted in the Target Exists prompt.](./media/ssma-table-convert-schema-overwrite.png "Select Overwrite")

30. Notice the error is now gone from the Error List.

31. We are going to fix another data type conversion issue now, which will otherwise appear when we attempt to migrate the data.

32. Select the `ORDER_DETAILS` table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer.

    ![The ORDER_DETAILS table is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-order-details.png "Select the ORDER_DETAILS table ")

33. Next, you are going to convert the type associated with the `DISCOUNT` column, `FLOAT(23)` to a `numeric(10, 0)`, similar to what you did for the `EMPLOYEETERRITORIES` table.

34. Select the **Type Mapping** tab, then select `float[*..53]` from the Source Type list, and select **Edit**.

    ![The row with source type of float[*..53] is selected and highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Edit is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssma-type-mapping-float-edit.png "Edit float[*..53]")

35. In the Edit Type Mapping dialog, change the Target type to `numeric(precision, scale)`, and set the Precision to **10**, then select **OK**.

    ![In the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, numeric(precision, scale) is highlighted under Target type, 10 is highlighted next to Replace with under Precision, and OK is highlighted at the bottom.](./media/ssma-edit-type-mapping-float-to-numeric.png "Change the Target type")

36. Select **Apply** to save the changes to the `ORDER_DETAILS` table.

37. Now, right-click on the `ORDER_DETAILS` table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select **Convert Schema**.

38. When prompted that the target exists, select **Overwrite**.

39. **Optional**: Save the project. This can take a while, and is not necessary to complete the hands-on lab.

40. To apply the resultant schema to the Northwind database in SQL Server, use the SQL Server Metadata Explorer to view the Northwind database. Right-click Northwind, and select **Synchronize with Database**.

    ![Synchronize with Database is highlighted in the submenu of the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-synchronize-with-database.png "Select Synchronize with Database")

41. Select **OK** in the Synchronize with the Database dialog.

42. The Synchronize action will result in multiple errors in the Error List, resulting from attempting to add the SSMA assemblies to the Northwind database.

    ![The Errors notification is highlighted at the top of the Errors List window, and the first of multiple errors is selected and highlighted in the Message list.](./media/ssma-synchronize-errors.png "View the errors")

43. These errors are the result of improvements implemented in SQL Server 2017 SQLCLR security model. Specifically, in SQL Server 2017, Microsoft now by default requires that all types of assemblies (SAFE, EXTERNAL_ACCESS, UNSAFE) are authorized for UNSAFE access.

44. For this hands-on lab, you will be adding the assemblies causing the errors to the trusted assembly list, which is synonymous with white-listing the assemblies. To fix these errors, complete the following:

    - Under the **Northwind** database in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer in SSMA, expand **Assemblies**.

    ![Three items are listed below Assemblies, which is highlighted below the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-assemblies.png "Expand Assemblies")

    - Right-click `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET`, and select **Save as Script**.

    ![Save as Script is highlighted in the submenu for SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-assemblies-save-as-script.png "Select Save as Script")

    - Save the script to the local machine.
    - Now, you will need to use SSMS on your SqlServer2017 VM.

      - Open an RDP connection to your SqlServer2017 VM, if one is not already open.
      - Open SSMS 17.
      - Connect to SqlServer2017, by entering **SqlServer2017** into the Server name field, using Windows Authentication, and selecting **Connect**.
      - Expand **Databases**, right-click on **Northwind**, and select **New Query**.
      - Paste the following query into the new query window, but don't execute it until you complete the steps below:

      ```sql
      USE master;
      GO

      DECLARE @clrName nvarchar(4000) = 'SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET'
      DECLARE @asmBin varbinary(max) = [INSERT BINARY];
      DECLARE @hash varbinary(64);

      SELECT @hash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', @asmBin);

      EXEC sys.sp_add_trusted_assembly @hash = @hash, @description = @clrName;
      ```

    - Now, return to your Lab VM, and open the saved `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.sql` file from the desktop with Notepad.exe.
    - Within the SQL file, locate the line that begins with `CREATE ASSEMBLY`, then locate the word `FROM`. Copy the binary string that appears after `FROM`. This value will span all the way down to the line containing the text `WITH PERMISSION_SET = SAFE`. Be sure not to include any whitespace at the end of the binary value.

      ![The binary string that appears after FROM is highlighted within the SQL file.](./media/assembly-binary-value.png "Copy the binary string")

    - Now, return to SSMS on your SqlServer2017 VM, and replace `INSERT BINARY` with the copied binary value. The line should end with ";" and there should be no whitespace before the ";".
    - Execute the query in SSMS.

45. Repeat step 44, this time for the assembly `SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET`. Make sure to replace the `@clrName` variable in the script with the value "SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET".

46. The SSMA assemblies have now been whitelisted in SQL Server 2017.

47. Return to SSMA on your Lab VM, and rerun the **Synchronize with Database** action on the Northwind database. This will create all the schema objects in the SQL Server Northwind database. There should now be no errors, and the Output pane should show **Synchronization operation is complete**.

48. Now you need to migrate the data.

49. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, select **NW** and from the command bar, select **Migrate Data**.

    ![Migrate Data is highlighted in the command bar of Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-toolbar-migrate-data.png "Select Migrate Data")

50. You will be prompted to re-enter your Oracle credentials for use by the migration connection.

    - Recall the Oracle credentials are:

      - **Server name**: localhost
      - **Server port**: 1521
      - **Oracle SID**: XE
      - **Username**: NW
      - **Password**: oracledemo123

    - The SQL Server credentials are:

      - **Server name**: IP address of your SqlServer2017 VM (obtained in the essentials area of your VM's blade in Azure portal).
      - **Server port**: [default]
      - **Authentication**: Windows Authentication

51. Select **Connect**.

52. After the migration completes, you will be presented with a Data Migration Report, similar to the following:

    ![This is screenshot of an example Data Migration Report.](./media/ssma-data-migration-report.png "View the Data Migration Report")

53. Select **Close** on the migration report.

54. Close SSMA for Oracle.
